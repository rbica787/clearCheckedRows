# clearCheckedRows
This code is written in google apps script for a basic list spreadsheet. If you attach the script to a trigger or a button, it will automatically clear anything in column B-D based off the checkbox status in column A. It then checks to see if column C has a filter and, if it does, organizes the column by descending value.
